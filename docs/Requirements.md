Brief
### **1. Project Summary**
**LearnTrack** is a console-based Student & Course Management System built using **Core Java**.
It will allow admins to manage:
- Students
- Courses
- Enrollments

The goal is to practice:
- Java basics (variables, data types, control flow)
- Classes, objects, constructors
- Static vs instance members
- OOP principles (encapsulation, basic inheritance, polymorphism)
- Collections (ArrayList)
- Basic exception handling
- Clean, readable code and modular design

This project is intentionally kept focused on **fundamentals** without advanced topics like concurrency, streams, or heavy design patterns. Those can be added later as the cohort progresses.


### **2. Learning Objectives**
By completing LearnTrack, mentees should be comfortable with:
1. **Java setup & compilation**
    - Using JDK, understanding JDK vs JRE vs JVM at a basic level
    - Compiling and running Java files via IDE and/or terminal
2. **Core Java Syntax & Basics**

    - Packages, classes, main method
    - Data types (primitives vs reference types)
    - Variables and their scopes (local, instance, static)
    - Typecasting basics
3. **OOP Fundamentals**

    - Creating classes and objects
    - Constructors (default, parameterized, constructor overloading)
    - Encapsulation using private fields + getters/setters
    - Basic inheritance and method overriding
    - Simple polymorphism examples
4. **Logic & Control Flow**

    - if/else, switch, loops (for, while, do-while)
    - Using conditions and loops in menu-driven console applications
5. **Collections**

    - Array vs ArrayList (why ArrayList is preferred for dynamic data)
    - Storing and retrieving objects using ArrayList
6. **Exception Handling (Basic)**

    - try-catch blocks
    - Handling invalid input, e.g., wrong menu option, empty lists
7. **Clean Code Mindset**

    - Small functions
    - Clear method names
    - Separation of concerns (entity vs service vs UI)


### **3. Project Requirements & Suggested Marks Breakdown (Total 100)**
#### **A. Environment Setup & JVM Understanding (10 marks)**
- Install and configure Java (JDK).
- Create a file: docs/Setup_Instructions.md with:
    - JDK version used

### **3. Project Requirements & Suggested Marks Breakdown (Total 100)**
#### **A. Environment Setup & JVM Understanding (10 marks)**
- Install and configure Java (JDK).
- Create a file: docs/Setup_Instructions.md with:
    - JDK version used
    - Screenshots or brief explanation of “Hello World” program run.
- Create docs/JVM_Basics.md explaining in simple language:
    - What is JDK, JRE, JVM
    - What is bytecode
    - What does “write once, run anywhere” mean (1–2 short paragraphs)


#### **B. Package Structure & Basics (10 marks)**
Base package (example):
com.airtribe.learntrack

Recommended sub-packages:
- entity – Student, Course, Enrollment
- service – StudentService, CourseService, EnrollmentService
- ui – Menu / Console UI ([Main.java](http://main.java/))
- exception – Custom exceptions (e.g., EntityNotFoundException, InvalidInputException)
- util – Simple helper classes (e.g., IdGenerator, InputValidator)
- docs – Documentation files

You must demonstrate:
- Proper use of **packages**
- public, private, and default access where appropriate
- Use of **static** variables/methods where it makes sense (e.g., ID counters)


#### **C. Core OOP Implementation (40 marks)**
##### **1. Entities & Encapsulation (15 marks)**
Create these core entity classes:
- Student
    - Fields: id, firstName, lastName, email, batch, active (boolean)
- Course
    - Fields: id, courseName, description, durationInWeeks, active
- Enrollment
    - Fields: id, studentId, courseId, enrollmentDate, status (e.g., "ACTIVE", "COMPLETED", "CANCELLED" as String or simple enum if you want slightly advanced)

Requirements:
- Use **private fields** + **public getters/setters** (Encapsulation)
- Add **parameterized constructors** (and default constructor if needed)
- Demonstrate **constructor overloading** in at least one class (e.g., Student with and without email)

##### **2. Inheritance & Basic Polymorphism (10 marks)**
Introduce a small hierarchy to practice:
- Person (base class)
    - Fields: id, firstName, lastName, email
- Student extends Person
- Optionally, introduce Trainer extends Person (even if not used much) to show inheritance

Show:
- Use of super in constructors
- Simple method overriding, e.g., getDisplayName() in Person and specialized behavior in Student or Trainer

##### **3. Static, Methods, and Utility Classes (15 marks)**
- Use a IdGenerator utility:
    - Static field like private static int studentIdCounter
    - Static methods like getNextStudentId(), getNextCourseId()
- Create meaningful methods:

    - In services: addStudent, removeStudent, updateStudent, listStudents
    - Use methods with different parameters (overloading example).

***
#### **D. Application Logic & Menu-Driven Console UI (25 marks)**
The core of the project is a **menu-based console application** in [Main.java](http://main.java/):
Example features:
1. **Student Management**

    - Add new student
    - View all students
    - Search student by ID
    - Deactivate a student (set active = false instead of deleting)
2. **Course Management**

    - Add new course
    - View all courses
    - Activate/Deactivate a course
3. **Enrollment Management**

    - Enroll a student in a course
    - View enrollments for a student
    - Mark enrollment as completed/cancelled

Implementation expectations:
- Use **ArrayList** to store Students, Courses, and Enrollments.
- All data can be **in-memory only** (no file DB needed for now).
- Use **loops and conditionals** to show and process menu options.
- Handle invalid input gracefully:
    - Option not found
    - Non-existent student/course IDs
- Keep logic in **service classes**, and keep Main focused on:
    - Displaying menu
    - Reading input
    - Calling service methods


#### **E. Basic Exception Handling (10 marks)**
- Create at least one **custom exception**, for example:
    - EntityNotFoundException when a Student or Course is not found.
- Use try-catch around input parsing (e.g., converting String to int) and menu operations.
- Show a clean user message instead of crashing the program.





#### **F. Documentation & Clean Code (5 marks)**
- [README.md](http://readme.md/) with:

    - Project description
    - How to compile and run
- docs/Design_Notes.md answering:

    - Why you used ArrayList instead of array
    - Where you used static members and why
    - Where you used inheritance and what you gained from it
- Follow simple **Clean Code** ideas:

    - Methods not too long
    - Meaningful names (addStudent, findCourseById, not fun1 or doWork)
